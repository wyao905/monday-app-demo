## Introduction

Welcome to Tasky! Tasky was created for the Monday.com Hackathon ([more info](https://mondayapps.devpost.com/) can be found here). Tasky is intended as a personal worklist/workspace for users. Users can create their own personal checklists and notes and keep track of their to do's and completion progress for their tasks from the main board.

## Inspiration

Tasky started off based on a conversation with other software developers and engineers that also use the Monday.com platform. As great as the platform is, there appeared to be an apparent lack of personal customization in terms of project and task management. This was further corroborated by our team's user experience research survey as we had reached out to various team leads and project managers and asked for their input. After several brainstorming sessions, our team decided on creating Tasky as our submission to the Monday.com hackathon.

## Instructions

This repo contains the front end portion of the project. You can test out a demo for the project by cloning this repo and running `npm start`, then navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser.

If you already have a Monday.com account, you can try out Tasky by clicking the button below and installing the app.

After it's installed, you can try it out in the item view panel by clicking the "+ Add View" button.

For the purposes of the Hackathon, Tasky is limited as a front end project demo. In it's current state, as there is no back end to retrieve and store data, any information inputted into the app will not persist between sessions.
