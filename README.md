# Introduction

Welcome to Tasky! Tasky was created for the Monday.com Hackathon ([more info](https://mondayapps.devpost.com/) can be found here). Tasky is intended as a personal worklist/workspace for users. Users can create their own personal checklists and notes and keep track of their to do's and completion progress for their tasks from the main board.
